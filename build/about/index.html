<h1>About bliss</h1>
<p><code>bliss</code> is a moderately minimal blog generator, with a build script below 100 lines of shell. It's forked from Bradley Taunt's <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf">barf</a>, and keeps things mostly the same while adding in a few little creature comforts for my own use.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Bradley described his motivations as follows, and I definitely identify with his thoughts here: </p>
<blockquote><p>This project was created by me, <a href="https://bt.ht">Bradley Taunt</a>, out of frustration with overly complex and bloated blogging options. I tried <em>so many</em> "minimal" generators but each one ended up having some glaring issue or heavy reliance on dependencies. </p>
<p>I wanted to have a system that I could easily replicate on any Linux machine. Something that didn't require me to download half the internet just to get up and running. I'm a sucker for keeping things simple.</p>
